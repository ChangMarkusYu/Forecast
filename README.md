# Forecast
Forecasting Malware Capabilities From Cyber Attack Memory Images

# Foreword
Before working with Forcast please make sure to read the 
[Forcast paper]() 
as it will help with understanding and extending the tool it if necessary!
Keep in mind that this tool is still not perfect, errors are not uncommon and knowing how to work with angr is essential.

With that being said Forecast is an incredible tool to speeds up analysis and can get you some insight into what a sample does without manually reversing it. Included are some sample memory images in (sample_dumps/windows_dynamic_loading/Dump) to illustrate in simple cases what Forsee is capable of.

# Requirements
Forcast has been primarily used on Ubuntu 14.xx and 18.xx machines and has been tested to work on those OS, but results may vary if using something else.

Python3.7-dev - Will not work without dev ~~~sudo apt install python3.7-dev~~~.
